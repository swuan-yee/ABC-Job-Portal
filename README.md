# abc-job-portal
The project is to design a community portal using Struct2 Framework similar to Linkedin.com. Users will be able to register in the portal using Register page. Users of the portal can search for others users using various parameters such as First Name, Last Name, Company Name, City and country. Users will be able to view the public profile of users after searching them. The portal allows users to login, request for forgotten password and update their profile information.
